            The document (represented by the DOM in browsers) is the actual page loaded into the window, and is represented in JavaScript by the Document object. You can use this object to return and manipulate information on the HTML and CSS that comprises the document, for example get a reference to an element in the DOM, change its text content, apply new styles to it, create new elements and add them to the current element as children, or even delete it altogether.The navigator represents the state and identity of the browser (i.e. the user-agent) as it exists on the web. In JavaScript, this is represented by the Navigator object. You can use this object to retrieve things like the user's preferred language, a media stream from the user's webcam, etc.
          </p>

          <p>
            The window is the browser tab that a web page is loaded into; this is represented in JavaScript by the Window object. Using methods available on this object you can do things like return the window's size, manipulate the document loaded into that window, store data specific to that document on the client-side, attach an event handler to the current window, and more.
          </p>

            The document currently loaded in each one of your browser tabs is represented by a document object model. This is a "tree structure" representation created by the browser that enables the HTML structure to be easily accessed by programming languages — for example the browser itself uses it to apply styling and other information to the correct elements as it renders a page, and developers like you can manipulate the DOM with JavaScript after the page has been rendered.
          </p>

          <p>
            We have created a simple example page at dom-example.html (see it live also). Try opening this up in your browser — it is a very simple page containing a section element inside which you can find an image, and a paragraph with a link inside. The HTML source code looks like this:
          </p>
        </div>
      </section>
      <section id="section4" data-nav="Section 4">
        <div class="landing__container">
          <h2>Section 4</h2>
          <p>
            To start with, you can get a list of all the stylesheets attached to a document using Document.stylesheets, which returns an array-like object with CSSStyleSheet objects. You can then add/remove styles as wished. However, we're not going to expand on those features because they are a somewhat archaic and difficult way to manipulate style. There are much easier ways. sThe first way is to add inline styles directly onto elements you want to dynamically style. This is done with the HTMLElement.style property, which contains inline styling information for each element in the document. You can set properties of this object to directly update element styles.
          </p>

          <p>
            At this point, we haven't really done anything useful! There is no point using JavaScript to create static content — you might as well just write it into your HTML and not use JavaScript. It is more complex than HTML, and creating your content with JavaScript also has other issues attached to it.
